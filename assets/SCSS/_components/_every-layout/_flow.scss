//Next up is flow.
// This is a super tiny utility that adds margin to child sibling elements, using a lobotomised owl selector.
// This means that we get tonnes of flexibility, because any element will be affected (unless they are display: inline) and we don’t have to add daft CSS that targets last children to remove spacing.
.flow > * + * {
  margin-top: var(--flow-space, 1rem);
}
//We first look for a --flow-space Custom Property and if that’s defined,
// it gets used. By default, using a fallback, we tell each child element to space itself 1rem from its sibling.
// The great thing about using a Custom Property is that we can control spacing in context without touching this utility again.
// Those Custom Properties are affected by the cascade too.
